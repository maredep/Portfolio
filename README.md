# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am Marlon. I am a passionate and results-driven data engineer with a strong background in designing and implementing robust data infrastructure. My expertise lies in developing scalable solutions for data storage, processing, and analysis. I thrive on solving complex problems and optimizing data workflows to deliver actionable insights.

## Machine Learning

- **[Binary Classification for PET-Based Feature](https://github.com/maredep/machine-learning-PET_ADC-dataset)** Identifying the optimal model (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) for leveraging PET data to improve diagnostic or predictive capabilities involves employing a Python-based approach. The selection process is refined through Grid Search and 10-Fold Cross-Validation, with the evaluation criteria focusing on ROC-AUC and F1 score to ensure a robust binary decision-making context.
