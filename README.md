# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am Marlon. I am a passionate and results-driven data engineer with a strong background in designing and implementing robust data infrastructure. My expertise lies in developing scalable solutions for data storage, processing, and analysis. I thrive on solving complex problems and optimizing data workflows to deliver actionable insights.

## Machine Learning

- **[Binary Classification for PET-Based Feature](https://github.com/maredep/machine-learning-PET_ADC-dataset)** Identifying the optimal model (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost) for leveraging PET data to improve diagnostic or predictive capabilities involves employing a Python-based approach. The selection process is refined through Grid Search and 10-Fold Cross-Validation, with the evaluation criteria focusing on ROC-AUC and F1 score to ensure a robust binary decision-making context.
- **Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, RF and SVM for Breast Cancer** In binary classification for breast cancer, we're using three different methods: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Think of Logistic Regression as estimating the chance of having breast cancer, Random Forest utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for classification, and Support Vector Machine as finding the best way to draw a line between cancer and non-cancer cases. These methods help us make accurate predictions about whether someone has breast cancer or not. 
- **Unsupervised Learning: Kmeans, DBSCAN and Hierarchical Algorithm for Iris Analysis** In unsupervised learning for Iris analysis, Kmeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical algorithms are applied. Kmeans groups similar Iris data points together, DBSCAN identifies dense clusters while marking outliers, and Hierarchical algorithm organizes Iris data into a tree-like structure. These methods help us understand patterns in the Iris data without having information about the flower types beforehand.
- **Feature Engineering with ADULT Data** In feature engineering with ADULT data, we work on improving the information we have about adults. This involves creating new useful features or modifying existing ones to enhance the performance of machine learning models, making them better at tasks like predicting income levels or understanding patterns in the ADULT dataset.

## Statistical Analysis and Modeling 
- **Philippine Health Care System** Analyzing the Philippine healthcare system with Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis using Excel tools such as Correlation, Linear Regression, Solver, etc. By using statistical analysis and modeling, we can uncover insights that help improve healthcare strategies, resource allocation, and overall effectiveness in the Philippines.
  
## Data Engineering	
### Data Modeling (OLAP and OLTP)
- **Philippine Sustainable Development Goal Data Modeling** Modeling data related to Philippine Sustainable Development Goals means finding ways to understand and improve the country's progress toward long-term goals like reducing poverty and promoting good health. By using data and models, we can make better decisions to create a sustainable and positive impact on the Philippines' development.
- **Retail Store Analysis System Data Modeling for Sales and Inventory Analysis and Reporting** The Retail Store Analysis System involves organizing and understanding data to improve sales and inventory management. By creating models that analyze and report on sales and inventory, the system helps businesses make informed decisions, ensuring efficient operations and better customer satisfaction in retail stores.
### Data Preprocessing and Integration
- **Shipper ETL Automation Pipeline**
- **Car Retail ETL Pipeline for Data Warehousing**
- **Feature Engineering for Real Estate Property Analysis**
- **Data Preprocessing for Sales Analysis**
- **Google Playstore Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature Engineering for Crime Analysis**
### Data Collection
- **Hotel, Restaurant and Tourist Spot Webscraping**
- **API**
### Data Visualization
- **Excel Dashboard for QR Coding Campaign** Developed a dashboard using Excel that utilizes charts and graphs to make sense of information from QR code campaigns. It provides a clear and simple way to understand campaign performance, track user engagement, and visualize key metrics, making it easier for users to make informed decisions based on the data.
- **Dashboard for Philippine GRDP using Power BI** Developed a Dashboard, built with Power BI, is a visual representation of economic data across different regions in the Philippines. It simplifies the understanding of economic trends, growth rates, and regional contributions, providing a user-friendly tool for policymakers and stakeholders to analyze and interpret GRDP information effectively.
- **Tableau**
