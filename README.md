# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am Marlon Edepcion. I am a passionate and results-driven data engineer. My expertise lies in developing scalable solutions for data storage, processing, and analysis. I thrive on solving complex problems and optimizing data workflows to deliver actionable insights.

## Machine Learning

- **[Binary Classification for PET-Based Feature](https://github.com/maredep/machine-learning-PET_ADC-dataset)** Identifying the optimal model (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost) for leveraging PET data to improve diagnostic or predictive capabilities involves employing a Python-based approach. The selection process is refined through Grid Search and 10-Fold Cross-Validation, with the evaluation criteria focusing on ROC-AUC and F1 score to ensure a robust binary decision-making context.
- **Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, RF and SVM for Breast Cancer** Using three different methods: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Think of Logistic Regression as estimating the chance of having breast cancer, Random Forest utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for classification, and Support Vector Machine as finding the best way to draw a line between cancer and non-cancer cases. These methods help us make accurate predictions about whether someone has breast cancer or not. 
- **Unsupervised Learning: Kmeans, DBSCAN and Hierarchical Algorithm for Iris Analysis** Implementing unsupervised learning for Iris analysis with Kmeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical algorithms. Kmeans groups similar Iris data points together, DBSCAN identifies dense clusters while marking outliers, and Hierarchical algorithm organizes Iris data into a tree-like structure. These methods help us understand patterns in the Iris data without having information about the flower types beforehand.
- **Feature Engineering with ADULT Data** Improving the information we have about adults. This involves creating new useful features or modifying existing ones with normalization and scaling to enhance the performance of machine learning models, making them better at tasks like predicting income levels or understanding patterns in the ADULT dataset.

## Statistical Analysis and Modeling 
- **Philippine Health Care System** Analyzing the Philippine healthcare system with Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis using Excel tools such as Correlation, Regression, Solver, etc. By using statistical analysis and modeling, we can uncover insights that help improve healthcare strategies, resource allocation, and overall effectiveness in the Philippines.
  
## Data Engineering	
### Data Modeling (OLAP and OLTP)
- **Philippine Sustainable Development Goal Data Modeling** Modeling data related to Philippine Sustainable Development Goals means finding ways to understand and improve the country's progress toward long-term goals like reducing poverty and promoting good health. By using data and models, we can make better decisions to create a sustainable and positive impact on the Philippines' development.
- **Retail Store Analysis System Data Modeling for Sales and Inventory Analysis and Reporting** The Retail Store Analysis System involves organizing and understanding data to improve sales and inventory management. By creating models that analyze and report on sales and inventory, the system helps businesses make informed decisions, ensuring efficient operations and better customer satisfaction in retail stores.
### Data Preprocessing and Integration
- **Shipper ETL Automation Pipeline** A streamlined and efficient system designed to automate the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for shipping-related data. By seamlessly extracting information from various sources, transforming it into a unified format, and loading it into a centralized database, this pipeline enhances the speed and accuracy of shipping data management, ultimately optimizing logistics and supply chain operations.
- **Car Retail ETL Pipeline for Data Warehousing** A robust data integration system tailored for the automotive retail industry. This pipeline automates the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process, facilitating the seamless transfer of diverse car-related data into a centralized Data Warehouse. By consolidating information from various sources, this solution empowers car retailers with a comprehensive and unified view of their data, enabling informed decision-making and improved operational efficiency.
- **Feature Engineering for Real Estate Property Analysis** Involves the systematic creation and optimization of relevant data attributes to enhance the accuracy of property insights. By extracting meaningful features from raw data, this process enables more effective machine learning models and data analyses, providing valuable information for stakeholders in the real estate industry to make informed decisions about property valuation, market trends, and investment strategies.
- **Data Preprocessing for Sales Analysis** A critical step in refining raw sales data to ensure its accuracy and suitability for analytical purposes. This process involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing sales data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. By preparing the data in a standardized and coherent format, data preprocessing facilitates more accurate and meaningful sales analyses, helping businesses gain valuable insights into their performance and trends.
- **Google Playstore Data Preprocessing** Refining raw data from the Google Play Store to enhance its quality and usability for analytical purposes. This essential step includes cleaning, formatting, and organizing the data to address issues like missing information, outliers, and inconsistencies. By preparing the data in a standardized and coherent manner, this preprocessing enables more accurate analyses and insights into app performance, user behavior, and market trends on the Google Play Store platform.
- **Feature Engineering for Crime Analysis** The systematic creation and optimization of relevant data attributes to improve the effectiveness of crime-related insights. This process extracts meaningful features from raw data, enhancing the capabilities of machine learning models and analytical tools. By refining and selecting key features, this engineering approach enables more accurate predictions, trend identification, and actionable intelligence for law enforcement agencies and researchers in the field of crime analysis.
### Data Collection
- **Hotel, Restaurant and Tourist Spot Web scraping** Web scraping using Python and Beautifulsoup for Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourist Spot data involves extracting information from websites related to hospitality and tourism. This process helps gather valuable data such as reviews, ratings, and details about accommodations, dining options, and tourist attractions, enabling businesses and travelers to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.
- **API**
### Data Visualization
- **Excel Dashboard for QR Coding Campaign** Developed a dashboard using Excel that utilizes charts and graphs to make sense of information from QR code campaigns. It provides a clear and simple way to understand campaign performance, track user engagement, and visualize key metrics, making it easier for users to make informed decisions based on the data.
- **Dashboard for Philippine GRDP using Power BI** Developed a Dashboard, built with Power BI, for visual representation of economic data across different regions in the Philippines. It simplifies the understanding of economic trends, growth rates, and regional contributions, providing a user-friendly tool for policymakers and stakeholders to analyze and interpret GRDP information effectively.
